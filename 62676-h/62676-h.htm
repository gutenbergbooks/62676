<h1>SEWAGE DISPOSAL ON THE FARM AND THE PROTECTION
OF DRINKING WATER.</h1>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>The conditions under which homes and their surroundings are kept
healthful in the city and in the country differ in many respects, although
the principles underlying them are essentially the same. In the city
the sanitary condition of homes is maintained chiefly by a system of
cooperation and centralization which brings into existence extensive
sewerage systems, water supplies, and the collection of house waste by
public authority. Regulations are prescribed and enforced under
which the individual household must avoid all conditions which are
likely to prove dangerous to the health of the immediate neighborhood
and of the entire community. In the country districts, and more particularly
in isolated homesteads, the conditions affecting the health of
the household are largely in its own hands, and more individual effort
is required to maintain healthful surroundings than in cities. The
farmer must supply himself with his drinking water and must get rid
of the waste of the household as best he can. On the other hand, the
inhabitant of the country is in many ways better off than the dweller
in large cities. Not only has he pure air to draw upon at all times, but
he can supply himself often with purer food than is possible in large
communities. Though he must procure for himself drinking water, he
is, in most cases, able to get a purer water from the ground than the
sewage-polluted fluid which is the only water accessible in many cities.
While he must get rid of night soil himself rather than have it disposed
of by a water-carriage system conveniently located within the house,
he may avoid the annoying complications of plumbing, bringing with it
the leakages of sewer gas, the plugging up of soil pipes by the roots of
trees or by articles carelessly thrown into them. Moreover, he has
it often within his power to acquire sufficient land around his house to
take charge of all sewage and waste and to utilize it as a manure for
enriching the soil. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that when
the circumstances under which healthful surroundings are procurable
are under the immediate control of each individual household they are
apt to be perverted through ignorance and neglect. Conditions may
then arise which are not only unfavorable to health, but which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
likely to lead to severe sickness at any time when the opportunity
presents itself.</p>

<p>Standing between the fortunate inhabitant of a large city whose
water-supply and sewerage systems are above reproach and the farmer
who bas it within his power to make them so with reference to his own
wants, is the half-developed village or town, with its chiefly unsanitary
conditions. Here the leaky cesspool still exists, close by the family
well, or by the neighbor's well. The absence of any system of collecting
garbage and miscellaneous waste shows itself by the littering of
the yards, the alleys, streets, and even stream beds with all kinds of
refuse. In some towns the premature introduction of a water-supply
system causes the ground to become still more thoroughly saturated
with diluted sewage, so that the wells of those households not yet connected
with the water-supply are a continual source of danger. In
such communities, appreciation of the necessity for a public control of
sanitation has not yet made much headway. The acts of each family
violating the laws of health not only react upon itself but upon the
immediate neighborhood, often with disastrous results. When typhoid
fever has once gained a foothold in such communities it is apt to
develop into an epidemic.</p>

<p>The tendency of our population to concentrate in villages and towns
makes the sanitary improvement of such communities a most important
and vital condition of national health and prosperity. The following
pages are not intended for these communities, for they need, in most
cases, the advice of sanitarians and sanitary engineers, acquainted
with local conditions. Still, they may be of service in pointing out the
dangers which may and do actually beset the population that neglects
to dispose of refuse and waste in a manner which does not clash with
the laws of health.</p>

<p>The chief dangers which threaten rural inhabitants are those arising
from polluted drinking water. This is infected from the household
excrement and barnyard drainage, as will be described farther on, and
its use leads in the main to bowel disturbances, typhoid-fever, and
dysenteric affections. It might be claimed that in an isolated homestead
the danger is absent because the night soil from the healthy
household can not contain the germs of typhoid-fever, and, therefore,
the well water can not receive them from leaky cesspools and surface
drainage. This would be true if the family lived secluded from other
human beings. As the case stands, there is much more communication
than is at first thought supposed. There is more or less coming and
going of farm hands and other hired help, of tramps, peddlers, etc. The
farmer travels more than formerly. He frequently visits neighboring
communities. The children go to school. As it has been shown that
there may be mild cases of typhoid-fever passing unnoticed, in a farm
hand, for example, who leaves on account of ill health, perhaps, and
who has meanwhile, in his discharges, deposited the germs of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
disease on the premises, it is evident that isolation nowadays does
not exist except in remote, thinly settled regions, and that disease
germs may make themselves suddenly felt in an unexpected manner
in any farmhouse.</p>

<p>There are other important reasons, however, why rural sanitation
should not be neglected. The health of the large communities of people
who draw their food supply from the country is in a measure dependent
on the health of the farming community. There is scarcely a city child
who is not, in a degree, dependent for its health on the sanitary conditions
prevailing in the house of the dairyman. Milk has been repeatedly
shown to be the means of distributing typhoid-fever and other
diseases. Any vegetable foods from the farm eaten raw are liable to
become carriers of infection under unsanitary conditions.</p>

<p>In many parts of our country other causes operate in making the
health of many people depend on the proprieties of country homes.
The thousands of city people, who flock every summer to the country
and bring to the farming community considerable sums of money,
should be properly protected against the dangers of polluted water and
infected milk by the adoption of suitable methods of sewage disposal.
Too frequently those who left the city for the purpose of gaining
strength by breathing pure air, drinking pure water, and eating
pure food, only return with the germs of an often fatal disease within
them to swell the typhoid statistics of our large cities.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="DISPOSAL_OF_SEWAGE" id="DISPOSAL_OF_SEWAGE">DISPOSAL OF SEWAGE.</a></h2>


<p>The vital thing which thus presents itself is the disposal of fecal
matter and other refuse so that the wells, upon which most rural families
depend for their drinking water, may remain pure. To this matter we
will first turn our attention.</p>

<p>Every person who tills the soil is acquainted with the remarkable
transforming power of the superficial layers of the earth upon manure
and excrement. Out of these offensive wastes harmless substances are
produced which are essential to the growth of vegetation. This power,
known as decay, is now generally attributed to very minute organisms
(bacteria) which are found in immense numbers in the superficial layers
of the soil, which diminish in number as we go deeper, and which completely
disappear below a depth of 6 to 12 feet, according to the physical
condition of the soil. Bacteria are more numerous where waste and
excrement are most abundant. When night soil and manure are deposited
in excavations or so-called cesspools in the earth, from which the
fluid matter may enter the ground at some depth below the surface,
where the air or certain kinds of bacteria can penetrate only to a slight
extent, the substances, which under the influence of the air (oxygen)
and of bacteria near the surface, would have decayed, now undergo
partial putrefaction with the setting free of disagreeable gases and
odors. The deeper layers of the earth slowly become saturated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
organic matter, which is carried by the ground-water into the wells or
springs near by. There is also some reason to believe that disease
germs live longer in the oxygen-free depths of the soil than at or near
the surface.</p>

<p>The extent to which the filling up of the soil with excrementitious
matter may go on in densely populated cities has been shown by Fodor
for the Hungarian city Budapest. By analyzing the soil at different
levels from the surface to a depth of about 13 feet, he found, over an
area comprising 15 acres, about 1,000,000,000 pounds organic matter,
equivalent to the excrement of 100,000 people voided during thirty-seven
years.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 425px;"><a id="Fig_1"></a>
<img src="images/fig1.png" width="425" height="373" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;The shallow barnyard well, with privy vault and manure heaps near by. The water is
likely to receive fluid from these at any time.</div>
</div>

<p>To the surface of the earth we owe thus a purifying influence whose
activity furnishes us vegetation and food on the one hand and preservation
from disease on the other. This purifying power is not possessed
by the deeper layers, and therefore the percolation of organic
refuse into them from deep cesspools is wasteful to agriculture and
dangerous to our storehouse of drinking water.</p>

<p>Even the surface of the soil when overloaded with sewage loses
partially its power of purifying the organic matter. After sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
rest, such an overloaded soil regains its original power. The purifying
activity of the soil from a sanitary aspect is the same as that governing
fertility from an agricultural standpoint, hence any further discussion
of this subject is unnecessary.</p>

<p>A hint as to the proper disposition of waste, excrement, etc., is furnished
by what is stated above concerning the purifying capacities of
the earth's surface. Waste, night soil, etc., should be deposited with
proper precautions on or immediately below the surface of the soil,
where it may perform the double function of ridding the household of a
nuisance and of enriching the soil itself. This leads us to a consideration
of the best means of taking care of the household wastes. These
are, in general, of three classes: First, fecal matter; second, kitchen
and chamber slops; and third, miscellaneous rubbish and ashes.</p>


<h3><a id="NIGHT_SOIL"></a>NIGHT SOIL.</h3>

<p>The proper disposition of fecal matter or night soil in the country
has been one of the most pressing and vexatious problems of modern
sanitation. Many plans have been suggested, much apparatus has
been invented to meet the difficulty, but opinions not only differ but
change from year to year and have led to different practices in different
countries. Moreover, different climatic conditions and the divergent
tendencies of rural populations in the various sections of our
own country make it impossible to apply the same scheme to the whole
country. Different degrees of prosperity and wealth, even in the same
locality, will bring into use widely different schemes to accomplish the
same end. There are in use several systems&mdash;</p>

<p><a id="The_privy"></a><i>The privy.</i>&mdash;The old-fashioned privy, at present still quite a common
thing even in cities, is, perhaps, the most favored method of disposing
of fecal matter in the country. A pit is dug and a small building set
over it. The excrement deposited in it slowly fills it up. The fluids
and the solids dissolved by them penetrate the subsoil and diffuse
themselves in the ground. Rarely is such a pit cleaned out. Another
is dug and the old one covered up. In this way the ground becomes
overloaded with refuse organic matter. It is even stated on good
authority that such collections of fecal matter have been found under
the dwelling; also, that the privy vaults have been dug until the current
of ground-water was reached which was to facilitate the removal
of the excrement. It is difficult to conceive a more pernicious custom,
or one more certain to pollute the drinking water. The privy vault is
the most rudimentary way of getting rid of night soil, and its dangerous
features are too plain to be referred to.</p>

<p><a id="The_cesspool"></a><i>The cesspool.</i>&mdash;Next comes the cesspool, which is usually connected
with a water-closet, and may also receive the slops from the kitchen.</p>

<p>These are constructed in two ways, either as water-tight receptacles
or as simple pervious pits differing in no way from the privy vault
excepting, perhaps, in their more dangerous tendencies. All sanitary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
authorities agree in condemning the leaky cesspool as a most shiftless
and dangerous method of getting rid of sewage. In most countries
they are prohibited by law in populous communities. In exceptional
cases, leaky cesspools may do no harm, as in an isolated house in the
country whose cesspool is built at a considerable distance both from
the house and the well. The safe distance from any well it would be
difficult to state, because that would depend on the character of the
subsoil and the general slope of the land. In any case, the cesspool
should be on lower ground than the well, as the current of the ground
water feeding the latter, usually but not always, conforms to the slope
of the surface. A fair estimate of the least
allowable distance between well and cesspool
would be 100 feet. Soluble salts from sewage
might still find their way into the well water,
but it is quite improbable that disease germs
could penetrate the soil for such a distance except
where fissures and cracks may be present.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 230px;"><a id="Fig_2"></a>
<img src="images/fig2.png" width="230" height="307" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Portable earth closet. A, the pail to receive
the excrement; B, the urine-separating receptacle
hanging on the open door; C, mouth of the hopper
conveying the dry-earth or ashes from reservoir D
upon the night soil in A.</div>
</div>

<p>In villages, leaky cesspools are still of frequent
occurrence. If the drinking water is
taken from wells, such cesspools are a constant
menace, and all that is needed in many such
towns is a spark in the shape of some disease
germ to kindle an epidemic. It is true that
years may pass by without the
occurrence of more than the
usual amount of illness, but
even then we have good reason
to suppose that in many villages
using cesspools the average
amount of sickness and
mortality is far too high, not to
mention the occasional epidemics
of typhoid-fever. We may
sum up the matter of leaky
cesspools by the statement that
they may do no harm near isolated houses on farms, provided they are
sufficiently far away from the source of water-supply. In small towns
cesspools should be prohibited, or only very thoroughly constructed
water-tight ones permitted, according to circumstances. The same holds
true for the well-known privies.</p>

<p><a id="The_dry-earth_closet"></a><i>The dry-earth closet.</i>&mdash;The dry conservancy system is a much better
method of disposal of excrement, and is extensively in use to-day even
in certain large cities on the Continent of Europe where sewers have
not yet been introduced. This consists in the main of the frequent
removal of excreta in the country by some man servant or member of
the family; in villages and towns according to some cooperative plan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span>
This system has taken various directions, according to circumstances.
Thus there are what is called the pail system, which consists in the
daily or less frequent removal of a pail receiving the excreta; and the
earth closet invented by the Rev. Henry Moule, of England, the chief
feature of which consists in the covering of the excreta with some
absorbent substance like dry-earth or ashes. In some places the
excreta are received into a well-built brick or stone receptacle and covered
with earth, from which they may be removed from time to time.
Of these systems the dry-earth closet has received the greatest amount
of attention and discussion. It consists, essentially, of a pail to receive
night soil, which is covered either automatically or with a scoop with
dry-earth (<a href="#Fig_2">fig. 2</a>). The earth absorbs the
fluids and the odors and keeps the closet
inoffensive.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 280px;"><a id="Fig_3"></a>
<img src="images/fig3.png" width="280" height="253" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;The old form of earth closet with frame and pail removed
to show the mechanism. The handle on the left when raised
throws into the pail a certain quantity of dry-earth or ashes from
the reservoir or hopper in the rear.</div>
</div>

<p>The earth to be used should be a rather
fine loam, sifted to remove coarse particles,
thoroughly dried by spreading out
in the sun or under a
shed, and then stored
in barrels. The drier
the earth the better it
is. The finer the particles
of earth the
greater the capacity
for absorbing fluids.
For this reason sand
is not satisfactory.
Goal or wood ashes are
quite satisfactory, as
they are, after proper
sifting, of the requisite
fineness and are thoroughly
dry. The mixture of earth or ashes and night soil should be
removed at certain times, depending on the location of the closet, the
season of the year, and other conditions. The more frequent the removal
the better. The mixture of soil and excrement is so unobjectionable
that it has been used over a number of times after being dried each
time. This can not be recommended, however, as it is generally accepted
nowadays that disease germs may remain alive in such a mixture for
some time.</p>

<p>In place of the movable earth closets, a water-tight, concreted area
may be built in an annex to the house, which is to receive the night soil
from a closet on the floor above with the necessary quantity of dry soil
(see <a href="#Fig_4">fig. 4</a>). Poore, from whose book the illustration is taken, recommends,
in addition, the construction of the floor of such a pit with an
inclination sufficient to carry away the urine into some gutter outside
filled with absorbent soil. The area should have suitable openings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
for inspection and for removal of contents, as well as for ventilation.
Waring recommended a similar system many years ago. The closet
described by him discharges into a water-tight vault in the cellar,
which requires emptying only occasionally. The contents remain inoffensive,
provided sufficient thoroughly dry earth is used.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 247px;"><a id="Fig_4"></a>
<img src="images/fig4.png" width="247" height="421" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Earth closet and dry catch (from Poore's "Rural
hygiene," scale, &frac12; inch equals 1 foot). To prevent drafts
the earth closet is closed below by a hinged flap which
opens and shuts automatically by means of a counterpoise.
The catch below is provided with air bricks and an air
shaft leading to a ventilator.</div>
</div>

<p>In cold climates, indoor closets are especially desirable to obviate
the exposure which can not be avoided when closets are out of doors.
For invalids there should be
a carefully managed earth
closet kept in a well-aired
room set apart for this purpose.
In warm climates,
earth closets should be frequently
cleaned. To prevent
the attraction of flies and
insects and the too rapid
decomposition of the contents
a little unslacked lime
added with the earth to the
excrement will be of value.
The discharges of persons
suffering from typhoid-fever
and bowel troubles should
be mixed with thin slacked
lime<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (milk of lime). One-half
to one hour after the
mixing, such discharges may
be put upon the soil, always
at some distance from a well
or spring, a stream, or a field
under cultivation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Lime, to be used for disinfection, should not be air-slacked, but kept in tightly
covered receptacles to prevent this from taking place.</p></div>

<p>In Europe, the use of earth
and ashes has been superseded
by peat dust. The
upper layer of peat is dried
in the air and ground in a
suitable machine. The
coarser particles are removed
by sifting and used for bedding
in stables. The fine
portion, which has a very high absorbing power for fluids and is also
capable of preventing odors, is used in dry closets. In Germany there
are at present about thirty factories engaged in the preparation of
peat moss for the purposes mentioned. Its great advantages over dry
earth should bring it into use in our country. (See <a href="#Fig_5">fig. 5</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span></p>

<p>It does not matter from a sanitary standpoint which one of the dry-earth
systems is adopted, provided the necessary attention be given to
it. Every system which can be recommended is bad if not properly
attended to. The conditions to be observed are:</p>

<p>The night soil should be received in water-tight receptacles.</p>

<p>It should be frequently removed.</p>

<p>It should be utilized in the garden or field by being placed under a
thin layer of soil.</p>

<p>To excreta from the sick, milk of lime or unslacked lime should be
added before disposal in the soil.</p>

<p><a id="The_water-closet"></a><i>The water-closet.</i>&mdash;There can be no doubt that to-day the water-carriage
system, as it is called, or, in simpler language, the indoor water-closet,
is preferred to all other contrivances. This is true for the open
country as well as for villages and the suburban territories of cities.
There is much to be said in
favor of the present-day perfect
contrivance for the rapid
removal of excreta and the
exposure thereby prevented.
But for all rural inhabitants
the cost should be carefully
weighed before a water-carriage
system is introduced
into a house, for none but the
best will answer, as all others
are likely to become nuisances.</p>

<p>The supply of water must
be sufficient to flush the water-closet
thoroughly and keep all
the pipes clean; the plumbing
must conform to that in vogue
in cities, with its traps and
ventilating pipes to prevent
the odors of the pipes from escaping into the house; and the disposal
of the large quantity of liquid sewage, the most difficult problem, must
be properly attended to or it is likely to prove more dangerous to the
water-supply than the old dry privy pits.</p>


<h3><a id="LIQUID_SEWAGE"></a>LIQUID SEWAGE.</h3>

<p>The methods available to dispose of liquid sewage in the country are
water-tight cesspools and irrigation.</p>

<p><a id="Vaults"></a><i>Vaults.</i>&mdash;Water-tight cesspools should be constructed of hard-burned
brick, laid in cement, and having a similar brick or a concreted bottom.
The inside and outside surfaces of the brick wall should be
coated with a thin layer of cement, and clay rammed in around the
wall, to increase its imperviousness to water. It should be vaulted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
above, and topped by a square or round central opening, covered with
stone or iron plate. Cesspools are also made of cast or wrought iron,
the joints being made water-tight. Cesspools must be ventilated by
two pipes, one rising several feet above ground, the other carried to
the roof of the house, barn, or other structure near by. The current
will, in most cases, tend down the short and up the long pipe. The
latter may be dispensed with and the soil pipe of the house act as a
flue, provided all branches are perfectly trapped.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 378px;"><a id="Fig_6"></a>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Settling chamber and flush tank for surface and subsurface irrigation of sewage. (From
Gerhard's "The Disposal of Household Wastes," 1890.)</div>
</div>

<p><a id="Irrigation"></a><i>Irrigation.</i>&mdash;The disposal of sewage by irrigation is by far the best
method now within reach. Two methods are in use, viz, surface and
subsoil irrigation. The first in its most complete form consists in
carrying the liquid sewage to a piece of ground set apart for the purpose
and carefully underdrained. The sewage is allowed to flow over
the ground in shallow channels. The fluid slowly disappears in the
soil and enters the drains as comparatively pure water, which may be
allowed to flow into a stream. For villages this is the best means of
disposing of sewage. Those who as village officials may be interested
in this method will find plans of such sewage farms, together with
faithful accounts of their operation and the results obtained, in the
annual report of the State Board of Health of Massachusetts for 1892,
page 559, and same report for 1893, page 563. Suggestions for its
application to country houses are given farther on.</p>

<p>For isolated rural homes, or village homes commanding a certain
amount of ground around the house, the liquid sewage from water-closets,
the kitchen and chamber slops may be disposed of by the
simple means of subsoil irrigation, first described by Mr. Moule and
subsequently elaborated by Colonel Waring.</p>

<p>The system as used at present in its most successful form consists,
outside of the house, of the following parts (see <a href="#Fig_6">fig. 6</a>):</p>

<p>Two adjoining water-tight receptacles of brick. One of these receives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
the sewage from the house and is intended to act as a settling chamber
for the coarser particles, paper, etc. This communicates with the second
receptacle, which receives from it the fluid sewage. This chamber
is called the flush tank and is provided with a siphon. When the fluid
has reached a certain level, the siphon is set in operation and discharges
the contents of the chamber at one time into the subsoil pipes.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 420px;"><a id="Fig_7"></a>
<img src="images/fig7.png" width="420" height="316" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Subsurface irrigation of sewage: <i>a</i>, absorption tiles (Gerhard's "The Disposal of Household
Wastes"); <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, lines of absorption tiles showing their relation to flush tank (From Waring's
"Sewerage and Land Drainage").</div>
</div>

<p>From the second cistern a system of subsoil pipes laid over a treeless
piece of ground, preferably a lawn, receives and discharges the
sewage into the ground. These pipes should consist of porous tiles,
2 inches in diameter and about 1 foot long, laid from 8 to 16 inches
beneath the surface of the ground, and with a gentle inclination of 2
or 3 inches for every 100 feet. The tiles should have open joints not less
than one-fourth of an inch wide. They are laid upon earthen gutters
and the joints are protected above by caps from being clogged with
earth. The intermittent discharge of the liquid sewage is quite essential
to the successful working of this system. If the sewage is allowed
to dribble away into the pipes certain portions of these will become
supersaturated with fluid and others will not receive any; the purification
of the sewage in the soil is thereby rendered imperfect. The
discharge of a large quantity of fluid at one time, besides scouring the
system of pipes, fills it more uniformly and distributes the work to all
parts of the subsoil system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span></p>

<p>The successful construction of such a plant requires the services of
someone familiar with it, and it is therefore not necessary for me
to do more than call attention to it here as a highly recommended
system for homes, especially in villages, where the proper amount of
land is procurable and where the sewage must be disposed of in a
manner both inoffensive and safe. In any case the soil of such land
must be porous, not clayey and retentive. Those who wish to familiarize
themselves with the details will find descriptions in the Sanitary
Engineer for 1883, page 530, by Philbrick; in "The Disposal of Household
Wastes," by Gerhard, and in "Sewerage and Land Drainage," by
Waring. The entire plant is said to cost $200 to $300, the annual
expenditures for cleaning, repairs, etc., about $10.</p>

<p>The method of subsurface irrigation just described may be too complex
and too expensive where land is abundant and neighboring houses
at some distance. The simpler method of surface irrigation may be
resorted to by laying out at some distance&mdash;at least 100 feet&mdash;from the
house a small sewage farm where the sewage may flow in shallow
trenches over the surface and slowly sink into the ground. Such an
irrigation field must have the same qualities demanded by subsurface
irrigation. Its surface should have sufficient slope and the soil should
be porous, not retentive. The liquid sewage, including kitchen and
chamber slops, is conducted to this field in a water-tight tile drain and
then allowed to flow into shallow trenches. To avoid the overloading
of the soil with sewage at any one place the main distributing trench
should be so arranged that it and the irrigating trenches branching
from it may be temporarily blocked at any point to divert the sewage
into one or more different trenches every day. In winter the warmth
of the sewage will keep it in motion and the filtration will go on
although the field may be covered with snow and ice. The use of the
flush tank as described above would cause a more uniform distribution
of the fluid over the field and make the filtration distinctly intermittent.
The ground between the trenches may be cultivated to increase
the amount of evaporation. If conveniently situated, an orchard may
be used as the irrigation field. It should be distinctly understood,
however, that marketable fruits and vegetables should not be carelessly
allowed to come in contact with fresh sewage, nor should the irrigation
field be near the well unless the latter is fairly deep and tubed or tiled
to the surface of the water.</p>


<h3><a id="KITCHEN_AND_CHAMBER_SLOPS"></a>KITCHEN AND CHAMBER SLOPS.</h3>

<p>The removal of kitchen and chamber slops is a matter which also
requires proper attention, as this liquid frequently gives rise to unhealthful
conditions, annoying alike to sight and smell when carelessly
disposed of. The simplest way to utilize kitchen slops is to pour them
upon plants about the house in summer, in winter upon the soil, each
time in another spot, so as not to supersaturate the surface layers of
soil in any one place. A means of less trouble recommended by Waring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
is to partly fill with soil a barrel with leaky bottom and cover this
with a layer of stable manure to prevent the puddling of the soil. The
slops filter through the soil and leave the barrel below as a clear fluid.
The barrel is emptied two or three times a year and the contents used
for fertilizer.</p>

<p>House slops may be disposed of by surface irrigation or by subsoil
pipes, as already described. The originator of this method, Mr. Moule,
may here be profitably quoted as to its simplicity and success:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Where there is a garden the house slops and sink water may, in most cases, be made
of great value and removed from the house without the least annoyance The only
requirement is that there shall be a gradual incline from the house to the garden.
Let all the slops fall into a trapped sink, the drain from which to the garden shall be
of glazed socket pipes well jointed, and emptying itself into a small tank, 18 inches
deep, about a foot wide, and of such length as may be necessary. The surplus rain
water from the roof may also enter this. Out of this tank lay 3-inch common drain
pipes, 8 feet apart and 12 inches below the surface. Lay mortar at the top and bottom
of the joints, leaving the sides open. If these pipes are extended to a considerable
length, small tanks about 1 foot square and 18 inches deep must be sunk at
about every 20 or 40 feet to allow for subsidence. These can be emptied as often as
required, and the deposit may be either mixed with dry-earth or be dug in at once
as manure. The liquid oozes into the cultivated soil, and the result is something
fabulous. * * *</p>

<p>On a wall 55 feet in length and 16 feet high a vine grows. A 3-inch pipe runs parallel
with this at a distance of 6 feet from it for the entire length. The slops flow
through this pipe as above described. On this vine year after year had been grown
400 well-ripened bunches of grapes, some of the bunches weighing three-fourths of
a pound. During a period of four years, for a certain purpose, the supply was cut
off. To the surprise of the gardener scarcely any grapes during those years appeared;
but afterwards the supply was restored, and the consequence was an abundant crop,
the wood grow fully 16 feet, of good size and well ripened.</p></blockquote>

<p>In place of an indoor sink, an upright tube or hopper may be constructed
out of doors in communication with the subsurface pipes into
which the waste fluids are poured.</p>

becomes slowly carbonized.</div>
</div>


<h3><a id="WASTE_AND_GARBAGE"></a>WASTE AND GARBAGE.</h3>

<p>The attractiveness of a rural home depends largely upon the promptness
with which all kinds of waste material are disposed of. The
abundance of space around the house is a great temptation for the
members of the household to use it as a place for storing rubbish and
useless, worn-out things. Sifted ashes are easily utilized in earth closets
and upon walks and roads, to make them compact and firm. Other
articles of no use, such as broken crockery, bottles, tin cans, etc., can
be thrown into depressions and gullies and covered over with earth, or
else buried in trenches where subsoil drainage is desirable. The
removal of rubbish is a very fruitful theme and might be dealt with at
length. Its importance as related to health and disease is a subordinate
one, and the reformer must appeal to the love of order, propriety,
and beauty in and around the home in order to make an impression.</p>

<p>Garbage is of much less annoyance in the country than in the city,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
where its collection and destruction is a great expense, and is frequently
very unsatisfactorily done. In the country, the household
garbage is fed to the swine and poultry, and is in this way profitably
used. There are, however, homes where garbage must be taken care
of in other ways. It may be buried in the garden or else burned in
the kitchen range. Recently a device has been patented which enables
the housekeeper to place the garbage in a section of the smoke pipe
of the range, where it dries out rapidly, burns, and leaves only a little
charcoal behind, which may be used
for fuel next day. This device has
been well recommended by sanitarians
(see <a href="#Fig_8">fig. 8</a>).</p>




<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="PROTECTION_OF_DRINKING_WATER" id="PROTECTION_OF_DRINKING_WATER">PROTECTION OF DRINKING; WATER.</a></h2>

<p>The next subject to claim our
attention is the protection of the
sources of drinking water. In the
country water is, as a rule, obtained
from wells and springs. The important
bearing upon well water of soil
purity demands a few explanatory
remarks concerning the origin of
well water. Wells are excavations
made into the ground to a variable
depth until water is reached. This
water is denominated ground or
subsoil water. Its origin may be
better understood if, for the moment,
we conceive the surface of the
earth as more or less irregular and
entirely impervious to water. The
rain would collect on this surface and form lakes, ponds, and streams,
according to the configuration of the surface. If, now, we conceive this
surface covered with sand or other porous earth to a greater or lesser
height, and the top of this be considered the earth's actual surface, the
water will remain in the same position, but it will be buried within and
fill the pores of the overlying soil as subterranean lakes, ponds, and
streams. In digging a well we remove this porous layer of earth until
we reach these subterranean streams or reservoirs of ground-water. If
the above description be thoroughly understood, the condition under
which well water may be obtained at different depths will become
intelligible, and it will also appear plain why ground-water may flow
as any surface stream and pick up on its way various substances which
have percolated into the ground.</p>

<p>When the bed of porous soil overlying the impervious layers is very
deep, wells will have to be dug down to a considerable depth to reach
the surface of the ground-water. Where this layer of pervious earth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
is of slight thickness wells will be shallow, and the ground-water may
appear on the bottom of gullies, trenches, and wherever the porous
layer has been dug or washed away.</p>

<p>The movement of the ground-water depends on the inclination or slope
of the impervious strata, and has been observed to be quite rapid in some
instances. By adding common salt to the water in a well its detection
in other wells at a short distance has been found a guide in the determination
of the rapidity and direction of the underground current.</p>

<p>When the ground-water resting on the uppermost impervious layers
is near the surface, and therefore not safe or fit to use as drinking
water, it may be possible by digging below this layer to find another
porous bed containing water. This source will, in general, be much
purer since it is less exposed to pollution from above, and since the
water has to travel longer distances underground. Such a deep supply
must, however, be protected from the superficial supply by a water-tight
wall extending to the surface of the deep supply, otherwise the
water from the upper layers will simply drain into the well.</p>


<h3><a id="WAYS_OF_CONTAMINATION"></a>WAYS OF CONTAMINATION.</h3>

<p>Wells are exposed to contamination in two ways. The surface water
from rain, house slops, and barnyard drainage may find its way into
the well at or near the surface of the ground. Or the ground-water
stream supplying the well with water may in its subterranean movements
encounter cesspools or seepings from cesspools, and carry with
it soluble and suspended particles, some of which may enter the well.
There can be no doubt that a large percentage of the wells are exposed
to contamination with refuse matter in the manner described; and it
now remains to gauge the danger to health and life which may be carried
in the contaminating substance. The danger of typhoid-fever
bacteria entering the water has already been mentioned. These may
be washed in from the surface or they may pass from cesspools near by
through fissures in the ground, passages dug by rats, etc. Whether
such bacteria can pass through the pores of a compact, unbroken soil
from a cesspool to a well near it is a matter not fully settled. Since,
however, the actual condition of the deeper layers of the soil between
cesspool and well can not be known, it becomes imperative to prevent
all pollution of the ground-water current supplying wells by either
abolishing the cesspools or else placing them at a considerable distance
from all sources of water.</p>

<p>Beside typhoid-fever bacteria, those organisms which cause digestive
disturbances, and severer troubles, such as diarrhea, dysentery, and
possibly other unknown diseases, may be carried into well water.
During cholera epidemics, polluted wells might form centers of infection.
Eggs of animal parasites may be washed in from the surface.
Again, the barnyard manure, representing the mixed excrement of
various animals, may under certain conditions be bearers of disease
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
germs, and such excrement should, under no conditions, be looked
upon as entirely harmless to human beings.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> It is probable that the filth which gets into cow's milk and which appears to be
mainly excrement of cows is largely responsible for the severe summer diseases of
infants fed on cow's milk.</p></div>

<p>Besides the protection of the ground-water near the well from pollution
emanating from cesspools, etc., the surface of the ground about
the well should be kept free from manure, slops, and other waste
water; hence the well should not be dug under or close by the house,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
nor should it be located in the barnyard, where the ground is usually
saturated with manure. It should be surrounded by turf, and not by
richly manured, cultivated, or irrigated soil. The ground immediately
around it should slope gently away from it and be paved if possible.
The waste water from the well should not be allowed to soak into the
ground, but should be collected in water-tight receptacles or else conducted
at least 25 feet away in open or closed channels which are
water-tight.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The water may be carried into the kitchen by running the pipe from the well,
horizontally, under ground.</p></div>


<h3><a id="CONSTRUCTION_OF_WELLS"></a>CONSTRUCTION OF WELLS.</h3>

<p>The well itself must be so constructed that impurities can not get
into it from above or from the sides. If water can soak into it after
passing through a few feet of soil only, it can not be regarded as secure
from pollution. To prevent this, the well may be provided with a
water-tight wall built of hard-burned brick and cement down to the
water level. The outside surface of this wall should be covered with
a thin layer of cement, and clay pounded and puddled in around it.
Or, tile may be used to line the well and the joints made water-tight
with cement down to the water level. Driven wells, i. e., wells constructed
of iron tubing driven into the ground, are, perhaps, the safest
where the quantity of water needed is not large and where other conditions
are favorable.</p>

<p>These different devices are all designed to keep water near the surface
of the soil from percolating into the well. To keep impurities from
entering the well directly from the top considerable care is necessary.
Such impurities are likely to prove the most dangerous because there
is no earth niter to hold them back and destroy them before they can
reach the water. Adequate protection above may be provided in several
ways. The sides of the tiled wells should project above the surface
and be securely covered with a water-tight lid. The ordinary well
should also have its sides project above the surface and a water-tight
cover of heavy planks provided, which should not be disturbed excepting
for repairing or cleansing the well. Under no circumstances should
objects be let down into the well to cool. A still better method of protecting
the water from above is to have the lining wall of the well end
3 feet below the surface of the ground and to be topped there with a
vaulted roof, closed in the center with a removable iron or stone plate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
The top should be covered with 12 inches of clay or loam; above this
there should be a layer of sand, and lastly a pavement sloping away
in all directions.</p>

<p>Too much care can not be bestowed upon the household well. It
should be guarded jealously and all means applied to put the water
above any suspicion of being impure. This is especially true in dairies
where well water is used in cleaning the milk cans, and where steam
and boiling water have not yet found their way for this end. Polluted
wells in such houses not only endanger the health of the inmates but
that of a more or less numerous body of city customers.</p>

<p>In those regions where rain water is the only safe drinking water, the
same care is necessary to protect the stored supply from contamination,
and no suggestions beyond those already given are necessary here.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</a></h2>


<p>In the foregoing pages it has been the aim of the writer to give a few
facts and supply a certain number of ideas which, in the mind of any
person who has thoroughly understood them and who thinks for himself,
may be safely left to ripen into schemes adapted to his own wants
and surroundings. How many resources a man armed with correct
views may find in the simplest appliances the reader may judge for
himself by consulting Chapters IX, X, and XI of Dr. Vivian Poore's
very interesting volume on rural hygiene. Whether the means for
utilizing household wastes there described and adopted by him would
be adequate outside of a limited territory of our own country, I am not
prepared to state. For the same reason no definite suggestions can be
made in these pages, owing to the wide diversity in the climatic and
other conditions obtaining over the vast territory of our country. The
writer has, furthermore, omitted all statements of detail which properly
belong to the sanitary engineer. The works referred to will, however,
supply those more directly interested with the facts and figures desired.</p>

<p>The principles to be kept in the foreground are the disposal of sewage
in the superficial layers of the soil in not too great quantity, the disinfection
of the stools of the sick with lime before such disposition is
made, the digging of wells in places kept permanently in grass and at
some distance from barnyards, and, above all, their thorough protection
from contamination from the surface and from the soil immediately
below the surface.</p>

<p>In every community there are public-spirited citizens who could do
much good by taking hold of the simplest and safest methods of disposing
of sewage and refuse, putting them into practice, and showing the
rest of the community just what good can be accomplished and what
harm avoided by a little continuous attention to sanitary matters. In
this way many may be led to undertake improvements who, with no
definite knowledge of the expense involved and with misgivings as to
the final success of the undertaking, would otherwise hesitate to make
a beginning.</p>
